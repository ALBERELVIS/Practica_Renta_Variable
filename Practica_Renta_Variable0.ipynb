        "As we observed in the **visualizations from Step 2** (particularly in the price evolution and spread analysis plots), the consolidated tape contains several edge cases that must be carefully handled to ensure accurate arbitrage signal generation:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Missing Data (NaN Values) in Consolidated Tape**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why They Appear:**\n",
        "- **Market Opening/Closing:** At the start of the trading day, venues open at different times. For example, BME might open at 08:00:00, while CBOE opens at 08:00:05. During this 5-microsecond gap, CBOE has no data, resulting in NaN values.\n",
        "- **Asynchronous Updates:** Even during continuous trading, venues update their orderbooks independently. If BME updates at t=100µs and CBOE hasn't updated since t=95µs, forward fill propagates CBOE's last known price. However, if a venue has never updated yet (e.g., at market open), we get NaN.\n",
        "- **Venue-Specific Trading:** Some ISINs may not trade on all venues. For example, a Spanish stock might trade on BME and CBOE but not on TURQUOISE, leading to permanent NaN values for that venue.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why We Must Deal With Them:**\n",
        "- **`.idxmax()` and `.idxmin()` Failures:** When calculating which venue has the maximum bid or minimum ask, if all values are NaN at a timestamp, `idxmax()`/`idxmin()` return NaN. Attempting to extract the venue name from NaN using string operations would cause errors.\n",
        "- **False Arbitrage Signals:** If we don't filter NaN values properly, we might calculate `NaN > 10.50` which evaluates to False, but then try to extract quantities from a NaN venue name, causing crashes.\n",
        "- **Incorrect Profit Calculations:** Missing quantities would lead to NaN profits, which would skew our total profit calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How We Handle It:**\n",
        "- We use `.fillna('')` before string operations to safely handle NaN venue names\n",
        "- We check for empty consolidated tapes and missing quantity columns before processing\n",
        "- We filter out opportunities where critical data (prices or quantities) is missing\n",
        "- We use `.fillna(False)` in rising edge detection to handle the first timestamp edge case\n",

        "**How We Handle It:**\n",
